# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct; please follow it in all your interactions with the project. You can find it [here](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

1. [Check GitHub](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/issues/) for existing issues similar your report/request. If you find one, add any extra detail you might think is helpful. It's also helpful to just see how many folks are affected by the bug. That's it!
2. If you don't find an existing report for the bug you've come across, add [a new issue](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/issues/new) outlining steps to reproduce, the expected outcome, and the actual outcome. Thoughts on how to implement the fix are welcome!
3. Project owners (right now, me) will triage these incoming reports/requests and label them appropriately. Everything will be added to the new [Theme Work kanban board](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/projects/1).

## Pull Request Process

1. If one doesn't already exist, please start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/issues/new) describing what you'd like to change. Remember to search first, to avoid having it closed as a duplicate.
2. Make the changes discussed. Ensure that the theme builds and continues to function as expected; you can also try building the [theme gallery to test further](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md). Place high value on page-load speed and responsive design.
3. Update the README with any new site/page parameters as necessary. If you've added new dependencies, make sure to list them too.
4. Open a pull request and include the issue you opened in step 1 as part of the PR. Changes will be tested and, when everything's good to go, will be merged in by the project owners.
