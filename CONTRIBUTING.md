## Pull Request Process

1. Please start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo/issues/new) describing what you'd like to change. Remember to search first, to avoid having it closed as a duplicate.
2. Make the changes discussed. Ensure that the theme builds and continues to function as expected; you can also try building the [theme gallery to test further](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes/blob/master/README.md). Place high value on page-load speed and responsive design.
3. Update the README with any new site/page parameters as necessary. If you've added new dependencies, make sure to list them too.
4. Open a pull request and include the issue you opened in step 1 as part of the PR. Changes will be tested and, when everything's good to go, will be merged in by the project principals.
