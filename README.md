# Indigo Theme

Indigo is a lightweight, responsive, typography-first theme for Hugo, marked up with [microformats2](http://microformats.org) for extra [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) goodness, including [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for setup and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Some portions of the templates use variable rewriting, introduced in Hugo 0.48, so you'll need to make sure you're running at least this version. You can check what version you're running with

```
$ hugo version
```

Follow the [upgrade instructions on the Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#upgrade-hugo) if necessary.

### Installing

Follow the [theme-installation instructions on the Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing-and-using-themes/#install-a-single-theme); the URL you'll want to use is

```
https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo.git
```

### Setup

There's a sample config.toml file in the root of the indigo theme directory (`config.toml.example`); copy it to the root of your Hugo site, and rename it to `config.toml` _after_ you've made a backup of your current config.toml file (if any).

Set up the parameters in the config file, especially those in the social and `params.indieWeb` section. Social identifiers that you leave out will not be added to the footer of the site.

You can configure the theme to show info about the author; by default, this information is shown; if you'd prefer to leave it out, set `ShowBio` to `false`.

## Deployment

You can add a line to your `config.toml` file to set this theme as the default:

```
theme = "indigo"
```

Or, if you use `config.yaml`:

```
theme: indigo
```
